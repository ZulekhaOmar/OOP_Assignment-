# Java Classes Assignment

This project demonstrates the implementation and differences between Concrete Classes, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces in Java.

## Components

### Interface: Shape
- Defines the basic contract for all shapes
- Contains method signatures for area, perimeter, and display operations
- Demonstrates interface as a pure abstract type

### Abstract Class: AbstractPolygon
- Implements the Shape interface
- Provides partial implementation for polygon shapes
- Contains both concrete and abstract methods
- Shows how abstract classes can provide common functionality

### Concrete Class: Square
- Extends AbstractPolygon
- Provides complete implementation
- Demonstrates a fully functional, instantiable class
